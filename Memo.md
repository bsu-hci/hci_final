I after some initial difficulties stemming from improper declaring of assets in the .yaml file I had the rarest of pleasures to have everything else come of rather well and as intended in this iteration.

This is because I overlooked that computer screens are larger than paper and if I had used my original design then it would have been comically large, or I would have left blank space on the screen.
